# Table Generator
In some online communities, collaborative writers doing joint storytelling with their original characters want to decorate their posts. They often use "posting tables" to do so, decorating their character's text, speech, and writing notes. This often involves custom HTML and CSS, which many players struggle with. They will do the best they can with the knowledge they have, which often creates posting tables with invalid HTML that can break parts of the site, or that will not work at all on mobile devices.

I created this generator to create an easy interface for creating responsive table code for the specific use-case. I tried to include a variety of features I know that players look to accomplish.

## Tech
- Vue.js
- Pinia (for state management)
- Vite (build & compile)

## To-do
- Include a base set of styles for the interface; most of it is currently un-styled
- Address some bugs and feature requests

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
